                            <p>A keratin treatment, often known as a Brazilian blowout or a Brazilian keratin treatment, is a chemical process that may straighten hair for up to 6 months. Keratin smooths down the cells that overlap to create hair strands, making hair more manageable and reducing frizz.
                                By temporarily gluing the hair back together, keratin can help minimize the appearance of split ends. Keratin may strengthen and reinforce hair, making it less prone to breakage. At JINTIN Keratin hair salon Madurai, our full portfolio of customizable keratin smoothing treatments is designed to make your hair healthier while addressing individual needs and hair type. Each of our treatments eliminates frizz, increases manageability, repairs damage, and leaves the hair noticeably softer with luminous shine!

                            <p>Experts at JINTIN hair and skin beauty salon and spa recommend getting a facial clean-up once a week in addition to your usual cleaning, toning, and moisturizing routine. Pollution, stress, and tanning all take a toll on your skin daily. Allow a professional to clean your face to remove the coating of grime and tan.
                                To rejuvenate your skin, all you need is a thorough washing, a gentle massage from an expert, and a hydrating face pack. Our specialists examine your skin type and select the components that are ideal for you. 
                                Use Sandal cleansing milk or Wild turmeric for basic cleaning, followed by soothing rose water to tone the skin and restore its PH balance. The skin is extracted after scrubbing with a mud-based scrub or an oatmeal scrub combined with rose water. The clean-up is completed with a pack that is most suited to your skin type.

                            <h3>Dermologica skin brightening facial</h3>
                            <p>JINTIN Skin Brightening Facial is a high-intensity facial with a brightening mask for beautiful, glowing skin. Vitamin C's brightening and regenerative qualities are absorbed into the skin to minimize the appearance of pigmentation, resulting in a significantly brighter and smoother complexion.
                                It contains a potent mix of 8 skin lightening and exfoliating chemicals that work together to break down melanin in the skin and remove hyperpigmentation swiftly. The finest skin brightening facial in Madurai is available at JINTIN skin salon and spa.
                                We recommend a minimum of 6 sessions for optimum results. You will progress through three levels during this time, improving your treatment at each level and increasing the peel's power for faster, longer-lasting effects.

                            <p>Silicium is found naturally in the body, particularly in the skin. It is required for collagen and elastin production (our support fibers). The quantity of Silicium in our bodies decreases as we become older. For maximum efficacy and fast effects, this therapy combines Marine Hyaluronic Acid molecules with Marine Silicium.
                                This facial is designed for ladies over 40 who wish to reduce deep wrinkles and raise the lines of their faces and neck. The entire look seems smoother and less wrinkled; facial features and the neck appear elevated.
                                Our skin service experts in Madurai advised to take a treatment twice a week for 1 to 2 months, depending on the needs. One session every three weeks can help you maintain your results.

                            <h3>Nose/forehead/chin peel off treatments </h3>
                            <p>One of the least intrusive ways to enhance the look of the skin is with a chemical peel. Chemical peels are most often used on the face, but they can also benefit the skin on your neck, back, hands, and chest.
                                Chemical peels are a procedure that involves applying a chemical solution to the skin, which causes it to “blister” and finally peel off. In most cases, the new skin is smoother and less wrinkled than the old skin.

                            <h3>Nail extentions </h3>
                            <p>Our award-winning nail technicians at JINTIN- Makeover Salon are well-trained, very professional and friendly, and always ready to listen to and fulfill your requirements. Nail extensions are gel or acrylic extensions that expand the length of your natural nails. The result will be the nail that is polished, beautiful, and entirely natural in appearance.
                                To keep your nail extensions in good shape, we recommend that you book visits regularly with JINTIN Makeover. Water and debris can get trapped beneath the nails when nail extensions lift, break, or grow out without developing the fungus. As a result, depending on how rapidly your nails grow, you must replenish your nail extensions at our Nail Studio every two to three weeks.
